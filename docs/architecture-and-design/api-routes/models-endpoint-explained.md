## Endpoint Summary

| Attribute | Value | 🫏 Donkey |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Method | `GET` | A read-only roster check; the dispatcher just tells the courier which donkeys are on shift, no slip required. |
| Path | `/v1/models` | OpenAI-shaped path so SDKs like the official `openai` Python client list models against this gateway with no patches. |
| Auth | Bearer token (when `API_KEYS_ENABLED=true`) | Even the roster is gated; the gate guard still wants a valid permission slip before showing the staff schedule. |
| Purpose | List the chat + embedding models the configured provider exposes today | The dispatcher's wall roster — every donkey currently on duty and what cargo type they're certified to carry. |

---

## Request Schema

`GET` with no body and no query parameters. The handler signature is just `list_models(request: Request)`.

There is intentionally no filter (provider, capability, etc.) in this build — the response is always the full active roster.

---

## Response Schema

Pydantic model: `ModelListResponse` containing a list of `ModelInfo` entries.

| Field | Type | Description | 🫏 Donkey |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `object` | `str` | Always `"list"` | Confirms the package is a list — matches the OpenAI client's expectation when iterating models. |
| `data` | `list[ModelInfo]` | One entry per available model | Every donkey on the active roster gets exactly one row, no duplicates across capabilities. |
| `data[].id` | `str` | LiteLLM-format model id (`provider/model`) | Donkey's stable name plus breed — what you would pass to `model=` on a completions or embeddings call. |
| `data[].object` | `str` | Always `"model"` | OpenAI-spec marker that this row describes a model, not a fine-tune or other resource. |
| `data[].created` | `int` | Unix timestamp set at row construction | Roster-print timestamp — when this listing was assembled, not when the donkey was hired. |
| `data[].owned_by` | `str` | `"aws-bedrock"`, `"azure-openai"`, or `"ollama-local"` | Which stable owns the donkey — useful when the courier is choosing between paid and free providers. |
| `data[].provider` | `str` | Cloud provider key: `aws`, `azure`, `local` | Short tag matching `preferred_provider` so the courier can pin a follow-up call to the same stable. |
| `data[].capabilities` | `list[str]` | E.g. `["chat"]` or `["embedding"]` | What cargo type the donkey is licensed to carry — chat replies, vector scrolls, or both. |

The actual rows come from `LiteLLMRouter.list_models()`, which iterates the internal `_model_map` for the configured provider (single mode) or all known providers (fallback / round-robin / cost modes).

## Internal Flow

```
client → CORS middleware
       → RequestLoggingMiddleware  (assigns X-Request-ID, starts timer)
       → APIKeyMiddleware          (only if API_KEYS_ENABLED)
       → list_models() handler
            │
            ├─ 1. Pull llm_router from app.state
            │
            ├─ 2. raw_models = llm_router.list_models()
            │     ├─ reads self._model_map for the active provider
            │     ├─ emits one dict per (provider, model_type) combination
            │     │   with id, owned_by, provider, capabilities
            │     └─ no network call — pure in-memory enumeration
            │
            ├─ 3. Map each dict to ModelInfo(id=..., owned_by=...,
            │                                provider=..., capabilities=...)
            │
            └─ 4. Return ModelListResponse(data=models)
       ← RequestLoggingMiddleware  (sets X-Gateway-Latency-Ms, logs status)
       ← client
```

No rate limiter, no cache, no cost tracker — this route is pure metadata. Latency is normally a few milliseconds.

## Curl Example

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8100/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GATEWAY_API_KEY" | jq '.data[] | {id, provider, capabilities}'
```

Sample output for a `local` provider deployment:

```json
{ "id": "ollama/llama3.2",         "provider": "local", "capabilities": ["chat"] }
{ "id": "ollama/nomic-embed-text", "provider": "local", "capabilities": ["embedding"] }
```

## Error Cases

| Status | `error` code | When it fires | 🫏 Donkey |
|--------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| `401` | `authentication_required` | `APIKeyMiddleware` saw no Bearer header on a protected path | Courier asked to see the roster without showing a permission slip; gate guard sends them away. |
| `403` | `forbidden` | Bearer token does not match a configured key | Slip was wrong colour — the gate guard refuses to even pull the staff schedule off the wall. |
| `500` | (default) | Unexpected exception inside `list_models()` (e.g. corrupted `_model_map`) | Stable manager dropped the staff schedule; nothing the courier did wrong, but the dispatch desk has to recover. |

(There is no `429` here because the rate limiter is intentionally not invoked on the metadata route.)

## 🫏 Donkey Explainer

This is the **roster pinned to the dispatcher's wall**. Walk up to the side window, ask "who's on shift?", and the dispatcher reads the active roster aloud — every donkey currently registered, which stable they belong to (AWS depot, Azure hub, local barn), and what cargo they are licensed to carry (chat replies vs GPS-coordinate scrolls).

It is read-only and cheap. No donkey is woken, no pigeon-hole is opened, and no line gets written in the expense ledger. It exists so couriers — and OpenAI-shaped client libraries — can discover what they are allowed to ask for before sending a real delivery slip to the [completions](completions-endpoint-explained.md) or [embeddings](embeddings-endpoint-explained.md) windows.
